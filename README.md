# flash-attention-prebuild-wheels

This repository stores prebuilt wheels for FlashAttention as required for OneTrainer.

These packages are graciously provided over at [mjun0812/flash-attention-prebuild-wheels](https://github.com/mjun0812/flash-attention-prebuild-wheels/releases) but stored in source control for the purposes of immutability and pinning to specific commits.
